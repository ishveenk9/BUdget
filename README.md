# BUdget-Website
 This was a project created for the 2024 Boston Hacks. It can be agreed upon that budgeting is one of the biggest struggles in college, and that is why we created a website that eased the stress of having to organize your finances while also offering financial advice using AI to those who needed it. What the website does is create a budget personalized to the user based on their expenses and lets them organize their finances. There are Tips for Terriers, as well as links to the dining plans and a nutritional calculator created in order to help users find out their other expenses and add them to their budget. The goal was to make budgeting more friendly to the average student without the hassle of overcomplicating things. The website also has AI to give students an optimized way of handling their finances by using how much they want to save in a certain amount of time to figure out how much they should be saving by the end of each month. This website was created mainly using javascript but also some css and html.
